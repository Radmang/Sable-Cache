Sable cache, **_version 65_**.

##Quick Guide - Switching Branches##
1. Go into directory of choice and open cmd or git bash 
2. git fetch (gets all updated branches)
3. git branch -v -a (shows all available branches)
4. git switch <branch_of_choice e.g. git switch development>

Note: "git checkout" was the way to switch between branches PRIOR to Git 2.23. As of writing time, it's version 2.37.
