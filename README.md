# Sable Cache

Sable cache, **_version 65_**.

## Quick Guide - Switching between Branches
1. Go into directory of choice and open cmd or git bash 
2. git fetch (gets all updated branches)
3. git branch -v -a (shows all available branches)
4. git switch <branch_of_choice> (e.g. git switch development)

Note: "git checkout" was the way to switch between branches PRIOR to Git 2.23. As of writing time, it's version 2.37.

Note regarding Intellij: the interface may still show as "Checkout" to switch branches. That's ok, just keep in mind it may change to reflect Git's word choice in the future.
